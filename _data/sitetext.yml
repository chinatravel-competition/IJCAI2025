      Travel itinerary planning represents a pivotal challenge in artificial intelligence, combining real-world complexity with the need for reliable, user-centric decision-making. As a ubiquitous yet intricate task, it demands seamless integration of spatial, temporal, and financial constraints while aligning with diverse user preferences such as budget limits, dining habits, and activity priorities. Despite advancements in AI-driven planning systems, existing solutions often struggle to balance long-horizon reasoning, multi-modal data fusion, and dynamic constraint satisfaction—highlighting a critical gap between academic research and practical deployment.
      
      The IJCAI-25 Travel Planning Challenge (TPC@IJCAI25), co-organized by Nanjing University, Huawei, JSAI, and FCS, aims to bridge this gap by fostering innovations in AI agents capable of generating robust, personalized travel plans. Participants will tackle the task of synthesizing detailed itineraries—spanning transportation, accommodation, activities, and cost management—based on user queries with heterogeneous requirements. This competition intersects cutting-edge domains such as Natural Language Processing, LLM Reasoning and Planning, Constraint Optimization, and Neuro-Symbolic Learning, offering a unique platform to explore the synergy of generative AI, recommendation systems, and planning technologies.

        desc: "You can get the **DSL annotation** [1] of the travel requirements in the query to help you build the plans. During the testing phase, we provide a DSL and symbolic verifier for user requirements. Developers can validate and refine their solutions using this verifier, such as employing LLM-modulo [2,3] to prompt LLMs with unmet constraints for plan refinement, or leveraging NeSy Planning (with Oracle Translation) [1] to control backtracking in the guided search process."

      - title: "Original OS Track"
        desc: "You need to analyze the needs from the user's **original natural language** needs and build the plans. During the testing phase, participants are required to achieve understanding of natural language-expressed constraints and automatically generate constraint-satisfying travel plans. Developers can enhance the agents through prompt engineering or post-training, improve efficiency via workflow improvment[1], or ensure constraint satisfaction through formal translation and solvers[5]. These are suggested approaches and participants are also encouraged to explore alternative methodologies"

      <strong>Evaluation Metrics:</strong> For both TPC-Oracle and TPC-Original, we employ four hard constraints metrics: Environmental Pass Ratio-micro, Environmental Pass Ratio-macro, Conditional Logical Pass Rate, and Final Pass Ratio; and three soft preferences metrics: Daily Average Attractions Visited, Averaged Transportation Time, and Daily Dining Recommendations. The overall score is calculated as the weighted sum of the four hard constraints metrics and the three soft preferences metrics. The weights of the hard constraints metrics and the soft preferences metrics are 0.1, 0.1, 0.25, 0.4, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, respectively. You could obtain all of these scores by running the provided script.

      <strong>Paper submission:</strong> All participants are encouraged to submit a technical report describing their solution. Top-10 teams in each track MUST submit a paper. Top-3 winning teams in each track will be awarded with a certificate. Paper sumbission link will be realsed in July.

      <strong>Phase 1 - Preliminary Round:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Devlopment on the released dataset</li>
        We have provided 5,000 samples with annotated DSL in the released dataset. You can use them for local development and evaluation. 
        <li>Local validation with provided evaluation scripts</li>
        Note that the Phase 1 testing will be conducted on 1,000 of these samples, and the corresponding data index is provided in TPC_IJCAI_phase1.txt of released dataset. 
        <li>Submit algorithm outputs through our submission portal</li>
        CodaBench URL: 
        You need to submit a zip file containing multiple result files named {index}.json, where index corresponds to each index in the Phase1 data. Each JSON file should contain the final result of travel planning using your method.  
        <li>Monitor your scores on the Codabench leaderboard</li>
        <li>Top 50 teams advance based on validation scores</li>
        Please complete the <a href="#registration-form">registration</a> before the Phase 1 Deadline (July 31, 2025 AOE). Teams that fail to register will be automatically disqualified from the competition. 
      </ul>
      <strong>Phase 2 - Semi-Final Round:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>New challenge dataset (with the same format of Preliminary Round) release.</li>
        The Dataset of Phase 2 will be released by July 31, 2025 AOE.

        <li>Local validation with provided evaluation scripts</li>
        
        <li>Submit algorithm outputs through our submission portal</li>
        <li>Monitor your scores on the Codabench leaderboard</li>
        <li><span style="color: white; background-color: #e74c3c; padding: 2px 8px; border-radius: 4px; font-weight: bold;">Important!</span> Code submission for verification before the Phase 2 deadline</li>
        The official verification will be conducted on an offline device with a 14-core Xeon(R) Gold 6348 CPU, 100 GB of RAM, an A800-80GB GPU, and a 50GB SSD. Drivers: 550.54.14, CUDA: 12.4. The Travel Agent needs to respond promptly to user requests. During the official evaluation, each query will be allocated 5 minutes of inference time. If the time limit is exceeded, the system will skip to the next query.  Please design your algorithm reasonably or use a timing mechanism to complete the planning within the given computing resources. The evaluation will be conducted offline. If your algorithm requires the use of a Large Language Model (LLM), please use open - source models such as Qwen3-8B/4B, Llama 3.1-8B, etc. Avoid using external APIs, such as DeepSeek API, GPT API, etc. We will repeat the evaluation five times and take the average of the overall scores as the final result. If there is a significant difference between the final result and the user's result on CodaBench, we will contact the participants for confirmation. Participation results that cannot reproduce the leaderboard results will be disqualified. 
        <li>Top 10 teams advance to final round</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Phase 3 - Final Round:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Official Evaluation on the private dataset</li>

        During the final round, the last submitted code from the semi-final round by the participants will be used, and no code modifications will be allowed. The organizing committee will conduct evaluations on the private dataset following the same process as the semi-final round to obtain objective score evaluations.
        <li>Paper submission before the Phase 3 deadline</li>
        
        Papers should adhere to the IJCAI template. The LaTeX styles and Word template are available <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit" > here </a>. There is no page limit.
        The papers will be scored by five experts organized by the organizing committee, focusing on clarity and innovation. Scores will range from 0 to 100. The final subjective score will be the average of the five experts' scores.

        <li>Official results announcement on IJCAI25</li>
        The final ranking will be determined by comprehensively considering the objective score evaluation and the quality of the technical proposal at a ratio of 4:1. The organizing committee will announce the results at the satellite event in Guangzhou. All participants are warmly welcome to attend IJCAI25 and our competition!
